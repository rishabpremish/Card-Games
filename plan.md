The biggest feature I need you to implement is a live poker game. People should be able to play poker with other people on the server and they should be able to create and join room. This is how poker works for reference

Poker operates differently than most casino games because it is generally a game where players compete against each other rather than against the house. Because the casino does not have a "hand" in the game, they use a different method to ensure a steady profit.

How Poker Works

Players are dealt cards and place bets into a central pot based on the strength of their hand (or their ability to bluff). The best hand—or the last player remaining after others fold—wins the pot. Common variations include Texas Hold'em, Omaha, and Seven-Card Stud.

How the Casino Profits

Since the casino doesn't win when a player loses, they make money through a fee structure called the Rake. There are three primary ways this is collected:

1. The Pot Rake: This is the most common method. The dealer takes a small percentage (usually 2% to 10%) out of every pot once it reaches a certain size. Most casinos have a "cap" (e.g., $5 maximum) to ensure they don't take too much from massive pots.

2. Time Collection: In higher-stakes games, instead of taking a piece of every pot, the casino charges every player a flat fee for every half-hour of play.

3. Tournament Entry Fees: For poker tournaments, the casino charges an "admin fee" or "buy-in fee." If a tournament costs $110 to enter, $100 goes into the prize pool for the players, and $10 goes to the house.

The Competition Element

Poker is the ultimate competitive game because the house is a neutral third party. The "house edge" is effectively the cost of "renting" the seat and the dealer. In this environment, skilled players (the "sharks") make money from less experienced players (the "fish"), while the casino takes a consistent, risk-free slice of the action regardless of who wins the hand.

Please implement the games like this with odds like this so that some users make money some loose money but we always make profit and people can compete with each other.
