Things you need to fix

- The odds on the slots game is too easy. Make it like a real casino. Here is what I want you to make it like
  Real slot machines in a casino operate using a combination of mathematical design and computer software to ensure the house always maintains an edge while providing random outcomes for players.

Here is a breakdown of the core components that determine the odds:

1. The Random Number Generator (RNG)

The heart of every modern slot machine is the Random Number Generator. This is a microprocessor that generates thousands of numbers every second, even when no one is playing the machine.

- How it works: Each number corresponds to a specific combination of symbols on the reels.

- The Moment of Truth: The exact millisecond you press the "Spin" button, the RNG stops on a number. That number determines the outcome. The spinning animation on the screen is purely for entertainment; the result was decided the instant you hit the button.

2. Return to Player (RTP)

The RTP is the theoretical percentage of all wagered money that a slot machine will pay back to players over time.

- Average Range: In a physical casino, RTP usually ranges from 85% to 98%.

- The House Edge: If a machine has an RTP of 95%, the house edge is 5%. This means that over millions of spins, the machine is programmed to keep $5 of every $100 wagered.

- Long-Term vs. Short-Term: RTP is calculated over millions of spins. In a single session, a player might experience a 200% return or a 0% return.

3. Volatility (Variance)

This determines how the machine pays out. Two machines can both have a 95% RTP but feel completely different:

- Low Volatility: Frequent wins, but mostly small amounts (keeps you playing longer).

- High Volatility: Long "dry spells" with no wins, but the potential for massive jackpots.

4. Virtual Reels and Weighting

In the old days of mechanical slots, your odds were limited by the physical size of the reels (e.g., 20 symbols per reel). Digital slots use "Virtual Reels."

A virtual reel might have hundreds of "stops." The casino can "weight" the symbols so that a blank space or a low-value symbol appears on the virtual reel 50 times, while the Jackpot symbol only appears once. This allows casinos to offer massive payouts because the mathematical probability of hitting the top prize is incredibly low (often 1 in millions).

5. Probability Calculation

The odds of hitting a specific combination are calculated by multiplying the number of stops on each reel. For example, on a simple 3-reel machine where each reel has 20 symbols:

\(20 \times 20 \times 20 = 8,000 \text{ possible combinations}\)

If there is only one jackpot symbol on each reel, your odds of hitting the jackpot are:

\(\frac{1}{20} \times \frac{1}{20} \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{8,000}\)

In modern video slots, the number of "stops" is much higher, making the odds of the top prize much longer.

Common Myths

- "The machine is due for a hit": False. Because of the RNG, every spin is an independent event. The machine has no memory of previous wins or losses.

- "Hot" and "Cold" machines: These are perceptions based on short-term variance. A machine that hasn't paid out in hours is no more likely to pay out on the next spin than one that just hit a jackpot.

- Changing the bet changes the odds: Generally, the RTP remains the same regardless of your bet size, though some machines only unlock the "Progressive Jackpot" if you bet the maximum amount.

- The next thing that I need you to fix is in the Slots game make sure spin and auto off/on button are the same size
- When a user gets their password wrong make sure that they don't see the convex error on the front end and they actually see something like "Invalid Username or Password"
- Remove the hashing user passswords
- I only want to see the chevron in the bottom right on the homepage. I dont want to see it anywhere else
- In the settings page make sure the logout button doesn't take the entire width
- Make 10 new themes
- Make sure that the level on the bottom right is only visible on the homepage. Also make sure that each game has a "How to Play" section on the bottom right like the higher or lower game does.
- Get rid of everything for the shop including frontend and backend
- For the loan feature make a feature where the user has to pay back the loan. So how I want this feature to work is if they have an active loan there should be a red circle in the top right of the bank inside the chevron. Then inside the loan shark modal they should be able to pay off their loan within the timeframe. If their loan is not paid back 10% of their account value should be deducted each day.
- In craps and roulette make sure the numbers you get are cleared when you make a new turn I don't want the numbers to keep appending at the end of the list
